nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Masking functions properly hide sensitive data (first 8 chars + '...'). Security tests verify no leakage. Functions now public and usable in other packages."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zap zero-allocation design. No blocking operations. Manual lowercase conversion avoids allocation overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with context wrapping. Proper resource cleanup (defer Sync). No panic risks."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "After refactoring: Code duplication eliminated via maskSensitiveData helper. Public functions enable reuse. Case-insensitive parsing improves robustness."
