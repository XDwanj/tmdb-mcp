# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Configuration validation prevents invalid modes. Signal handling is secure. Token management unchanged (already validated in Story 4.2)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Both modes share single TMDB client instance with unified rate limiting. Graceful shutdown completes within 10s timeout. No performance degradation observed."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling in all three mode functions. WaitGroup ensures proper coordination during shutdown. Context cancellation prevents goroutine leaks."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation into three mode functions (runStdioMode, runSSEMode, runBothModes). Well-documented with clear comments. Follows Go best practices and project coding standards."
