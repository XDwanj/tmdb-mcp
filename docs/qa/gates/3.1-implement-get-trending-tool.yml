# Evidence of thorough testing

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API key properly secured, no sensitive data logging. Parameter validation prevents injection attacks."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Response time < 3s verified in integration tests. Rate limiting properly implemented (40 req/10s)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling (401/404/429/500). 404 returns empty results instead of error. Retry logic inherited from Resty client configuration."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, consistent naming, excellent documentation. Follows project conventions."
