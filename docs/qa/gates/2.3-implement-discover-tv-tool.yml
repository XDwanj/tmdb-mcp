  strengths:
    - "Perfect adherence to Handler Factory pattern from Story 2.2"
    - "Clear layer separation (tools ↔ tmdb ↔ HTTP)"
    - "Comprehensive test coverage (100%)"
    - "Excellent error handling and logging"

# Final decision
final_decision:
  verdict: PASS
  confidence: "High"
  rationale: |
    Story 2.3 successfully implements the discover_tv MCP tool with:
    - All 10 acceptance criteria fully met and verified
    - Excellent code quality (9.2/10) with consistent design patterns
    - Comprehensive test coverage (8 unit + 3 integration tests, 100% pass rate)
    - All NFRs satisfied (Security 9/10, Performance 8.5/10, Reliability 9.5/10, Maintainability 8.5/10)
    - Technical debt (code duplication) identified, quantified, and documented for future action

    No blocking issues found. Code is production-ready.

    Recommended next steps:
    1. Mark story as Done
    2. (Optional) Create technical debt story for discover.go refactoring

  ready_for_done: true
