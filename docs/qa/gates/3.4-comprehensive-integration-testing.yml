# Detailed findings summary
findings_summary: |
  ✅ **PASS** - Exceptional quality implementation

  **Strengths**:
  - 28+ integration tests with 100% pass rate
  - Test coverage 87.5% exceeds 70% target by 17.5%
  - Performance 2.34s exceeds 10s requirement by 76.6%
  - Concurrent safety verified (go test -race PASS)

  - Go naming conventions: ✅
  - Context usage: ✅
  - Error handling: ✅
  - Logging (t.Logf): ✅
  - Test organization: ✅

  **Zero Technical Debt**:
  - No security concerns

  - No code quality issues
  - No missing tests
  - Documentation complete

# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  This story receives a clean PASS based on the following deterministic criteria:

  1. **All ACs Satisfied** (7/7):
     - AC1: 20 single-tool tests with 100% pass rate ✅
     - AC2: 3 multi-tool combination scenarios ✅
     - AC3: Performance test 2.34s < 10s ✅
     - AC4: Concurrent test PASS with race detector ✅
     - AC5: Error scenario tests comprehensive ✅
     - AC6: Coverage 87.5% > 70% target ✅
     - AC7: Test results documentation complete ✅

  2. **All NFRs PASS**:
     - Security: PASS (no concerns)
     - Performance: PASS (exceeds by 76.6%)
     - Reliability: PASS (race-free, robust error handling)
     - Maintainability: PASS (clear, well-documented)

  3. **Zero Issues**:
     - 0 FAIL-level issues
     - 0 CONCERNS-level issues
     - 0 technical debt

  4. **Quality Score**: 100/100
     - Formula: 100 - (20 × FAILs) - (10 × CONCERNS) = 100

  **Conclusion**: This implementation sets a high standard for integration testing
  and serves as an excellent reference for future test development.
